                <head>The apple</head>
                <p>This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ; and Homer
                    describes it as valuable in his time... As a food, the
                    apple cannot be considered to rank high, as more than
                    the half of it consists of water, and the rest of its
                    properties are not the most nourishing. It is however a
                    useful adjunct to other kinds of food, and, when
                    cooked, is esteemed as slightly laxative.</p>
